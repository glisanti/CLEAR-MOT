#CLEAR-MOT

A standard metric for evaluating the multiple target tracking algorithm is the CLEAR MOT.  This metric is described in the paper [1] .

## Details

We provide the code that implements the metric CLER-MOT has described by the authors in [1]. The function is implemented in MATLAB and has been tested
on real data generated by a multiple-target tracker.

The tarball contains these MATLAB/Octave files:

1. generateData.m create the basic structures for the algorithm. Ground-truth objects are specificated by bounding box as [tl.x tl.y width height] in the "gt" cell structure. The "result" structure contains the tracking hypothesis as taken from the ground truth files. 
1. evaluateMOT.m is the function that perform the evaluation.
1. demo.m is the main file that you can launch to test the CLEAR-MOT script.
1. GreedyAssociation.m is the file that performs the association give the distance matrix. You can replace with other solver like Hungarian algorithm. These files are an example: if you want to use the script to evaluate you multiple target tracking, you have to recreate the structures groundtruth.mat and result.mat with your own data.


## Demo Example
To run our code and have a brief results just copy-paste this code:
	
	%this gives the results and the groundtruth
	generateData
	%threshold used to associate a tracker to a ground-truth
	VOCscore = 0.5;
	%display the result at the end
	dispON  = true;
	% run evaluation and save the result in a structure 'ClearMOT'
	ClearMOT = evaluateMOT(gt,result,VOCscore,dispON);
